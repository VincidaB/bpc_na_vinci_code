TODO soon: 


- [ ] handle multiple 2D detectors
    - [ ] store multiple 2D detectors
    - [ ] select only the relevant 2D detectors depending on obj_id
- [ ] load the different 3D models depending on the objject detected.
- [ ] return the correct pose of the object in the world frame
- [ ] go through only 1 or 2 or 3 cameras
- [ ] Check the results :
    - [ ] check the 2d detections
    - [ ] check the masks
    - [ ] check the 3D estimated poses

- [ ] change `requirements.txt` to reflect the new packages used in the conda env
